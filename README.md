### 4 - From next month, I want to increase the rental rates of all movies to 1€. Please send an UPDATE script so I can run it when the time comes.
```
UPDATE film 
SET rental_rate = rental_rate + 1;
```

### 6 - Some customers took more time than the rental duration of the movie to return it back to us and I want to warn them via an email. Please send me their name, surname, and email address.

```
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE consulta AS(
SELECT 
    t4.customer_id,
    t4.email,
    t3.rental_duration,
    DATEDIFF(t1.return_date, t1.rental_date) as diff 
FROM rental as t1
	JOIN 
inventory as t2 ON t2.inventory_id = t1.inventory_id
	JOIN 
film as t3 ON t3.film_id = t2.film_id
	JOIN 
customer as t4 ON t4.customer_id = t1.customer_id);

------------------------------------------------------

SELECT 
    DISTINCT(customer_id),
    email,
    CASE WHEN diff > rental_duration THEN 'Delayed'
    ELSE 'on_time'
	END as result
FROM 
	consulta
HAVING result = 'Delayed';
```

### 7 - I would like to remove all the information of the least 3 rented movies from the database to prevent customers from renting them again. Please send me the DELETE script so I can run it on the live server.
